# Mists of Tirna Scithe
`Night Fae players can click a bunch of stuff in the dungeon to get buffs for the group, skip trash, or open checkpoints. Look out for them!`

## Ingra Maloch
### Trash
`Dispel Soul Split from tank. Interrupt Harvest Essence from Harvesters. Tank will aim beam from tall mobs away from group. Take Overgrowth into the pack to get cleaved. Boughbreakers do a big AOE at 50% so focus 1 at a time. Stay out of AOEs.`

### Boss
`Focus tall mob when it is hostile. Save CDs for short boss. Dodge beams and swirlies.`

## Mistcaller
### Trash
`In this section we find the symbol with a unique feature. Between [full/empty], [circle/none], and [flower/leaf], for 1 of these categories only 1 symbol will be unique. After each trash pack a person should stand near every pillar so we can see them.`

### Boss
`Tank interrupts Patty Cake. Dodge the balls that fire from blue arrows. The fox add fixates someone and stuns anyone it touches. Kite and kill the fox. The boss will split into clones 3 times, and the group has to kill the unique symbol clone.`

## Tred'ova
### Trash
`Keep Staghorns interrupted. There is a knockback ability in the section, so be careful!`

### Boss
Pre-Mythic: `Dodge AoEs. If larva fixate you, drag them through melee. When Mind Linked, run from who you are linked to. Focus boss when shielded so it can be interrupted.`

Mythic: `Dodge AoEs. Interrupt Parasite abilities or it spawns parasites that need to be focused. If larva fixate you, drag them through melee. When Mind Linked, run from who you are linked to. Focus boss when shielded so it can be interrupted.`
